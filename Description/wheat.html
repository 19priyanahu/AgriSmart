          <li>Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important staple food crops in the world, forming the base of
            bread, chapati, pasta, noodles, biscuits, and many bakery products. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae)
            and is the second most cultivated cereal after rice. Wheat provides a major share of carbohydrates and
            proteins to human diets. It is widely grown in temperate regions and is a key crop in India, China, Russia,
            USA, France, and Canada.</li><br>
          <li>Wheat is a cool-season crop that grows best in regions with temperate climates. The ideal temperature
            range is 10°C to 25°C, though it can tolerate up to 30°C at maturity. Unlike rice or millet, wheat requires
            a relatively dry and cool climate during its growth stages and bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It
            cannot withstand heavy rainfall or frost, as both reduce yield and grain quality.</li><br>
          <li>Wheat requires moderate water compared to rice. On average, it needs about 450–650 mm of water during its
            entire life cycle. Irrigation is especially important at critical stages: crown root initiation, tillering,
            jointing, heading, and grain filling. Too much standing water can damage wheat, so well-drained soils are
            ideal. In areas with assured irrigation, wheat yields are much higher, while in rainfed regions, yields are
            lower but the crop can still survive.</li><br>
          <li>Wheat is mainly a Rabi crop in India and other South Asian countries. It is sown during the winter season
            (November–December) and harvested in spring (March–April). In temperate countries, wheat is also grown as a
            summer crop. Its short day-length requirement makes it perfect for winter cultivation in irrigated plains
            such as the Indo-Gangetic belt of India. In areas with sufficient irrigation, multiple wheat varieties allow
            staggered sowing and harvesting for better yield.</li><br>
          <li>Wheat is rich in carbohydrates, protein (about 12%), dietary fiber, and essential minerals such as
            magnesium, phosphorus, and iron. Whole wheat products provide more nutrition compared to refined wheat
            flour. Economically, wheat is the backbone of global food security and trade. It provides livelihood to
            millions of farmers and is a key commodity in international markets. India, after China, is the
            second-largest producer of wheat, and regions like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh are known as the wheat
            bowl of India. Its importance as a staple ensures its place in diets across the globe.</li>
