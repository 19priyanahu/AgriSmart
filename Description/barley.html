          <li>Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the oldest cultivated cereal grains, grown for more than 10,000 years. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is used for food, animal feed, and brewing industries. Barley grains are commonly processed into flour, soups, porridge, and malt for beer and whisky. Compared to rice and wheat, barley is more tolerant to harsh conditions, which makes it a vital crop in arid and semi-arid regions.</li><br>
          <li>Barley is a cool-season crop, thriving best in temperate climates. The ideal temperature range is 12°C to 25°C, though it can tolerate slightly lower temperatures than wheat. It prefers dry, cool weather during growth and requires bright sunshine for proper ripening. Barley is more tolerant to salinity, drought, and frost compared to wheat, making it suitable for marginal lands. However, very high rainfall or humidity can affect grain quality, especially for malting purposes.li><br>
          <li>Barley requires low to moderate water compared to rice and wheat. On average, it needs around 350–500 mm of water during its growing season. It is often grown under rainfed conditions in dry areas, though irrigated barley provides higher yields. Since barley is sensitive to waterlogging, well-drained soils are essential. Irrigation is mainly required at the tillering and grain-filling stages for maximum productivity.</li><br>
          <li>In India, barley is a Rabi crop, sown in November–December and harvested between March–April. In temperate regions of Europe and North America, it is often grown as a spring crop (sown in April–May and harvested in summer). Its short growing period (90–120 days) makes it highly adaptable, allowing farmers to use it as a rotation crop with wheat and other cereals. Because of its resilience, barley is also cultivated in hilly regions and marginal soils where wheat may not thrive.</li><br>
          <li>Barley is rich in fiber (especially beta-glucan), protein (10–12%), vitamins (B-complex), and minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium. Its high fiber content supports digestion and heart health. Economically, barley is important as both a food grain and industrial crop. A large portion of global barley production goes into malting and brewing industries for beer and whisky. It is also widely used as animal feed. Countries like Russia, Germany, France, and Canada are among the leading producers, while in India, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are major barley-growing states.</li>
